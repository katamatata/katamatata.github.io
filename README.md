WhattaCook

As a final project, while studying JavaScript, I have designed and built this recipe web application. When you open WhattaCook you see the two-column structure: the first column being filled up with random recipes from the API and the main column being filled up with the information of the selected recipe. Here you will see the ingredients, serving size, cooking time, heart icon and step-by-step directions.

To make UX more extended, it allows the user to find the recipes, filtered by ingredients he has. The user also can save recipes to favorites. Clicking on the heart icon in the top right corner allows the user to see the list of his favorite recipes.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, REST API.
